## Jibber README

### Introduction

> Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.

Confucius had it right a long time ago, but we still fall into the same trap today. _Jibber_ strives to take that quote to heart and keep things simple instead of making them overly complicated. Blogging is about the content, and _Jibber_ tries to put as few levels as possible between a writer and his/her readers.

_Jibber_, quite simply, is an open source blogging engine written using the Ruby on Rails framework with the explicit goal of allowing a blogger a simple way to post their content without having to fool around with an unlimited number of options or configuration. _Jibber_ is not extensible, it is not highly configurable, and it is probably not for you. However, it is simple and easy to use.
